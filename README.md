# tic-tac-toe
Tic-Tac-Toe is a classic two-player game where players take turns marking a 3x3 grid with Xs and Os. The objective is to be the first to align three symbols in a rowâ€”vertically, horizontally, or diagonally. The game ends when one player wins or if all cells are filled without a winner, resulting in a draw. Enjoy the challenge with friends!
